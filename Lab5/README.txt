 What was your design approach? 
        I write in python first, and to make a same program. Then, translate each part to mips. In this way, I will not lose myself and 
always know that which part I'm doing. 

 What did you learn in this lab? Write the answer here. 
        I learned how to use subroutines in MIPS which is a powerful way to write a program. Also, I learned how to use $a Regs. as 
arguments to path data to each subroutines. And finally, I learned that how to use stack to store data. 

 Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable? 
        At the beginning of the lab, I can't understand why each subroatain use the same Reg. such as $a0, $a1. After I searched on 
Internet, I found that it is same as arguments for method as other programming language such java, python.  Finishing a block of 
the subrotain is the most enjoyable time in this lab I think.
 
 How would you redesign this lab to make it better? 
         If I have chance to redesign this lab, I would improve my comments. When I was  working on the lab, I felt that it is hard to 
find a specific subroutain.  So improvement on this aspect would provide more readability for code reader. 

 What resources did you use to complete this lab? 
         YouYube videos,  reddit, and stack overflow.

 Did you work with anyone on the lab? Describe the level of collaboration. 
       No, I did it by myself.
