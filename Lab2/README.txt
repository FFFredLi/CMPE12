 What did you learn in this lab? 
 I learned how to use D latch to store data and practice more to use every kinds of gate. 

 What worked well? 
I think I learned alot in this lab. Firstly, I improved my skills to use gate to design circuits. And it also let me know lots of stuff outside the class which come from Internet. 
Also the lab proves a chance to review flip flop, to better understand which kind of flip flop best suit for situation.

Did you encounter any issues? 
Yes. When I draw register's parts, I even don't know how to begin. And I watched lots of Youtube video to learn how to use.

 How would you redesign this lab to make it better? 
 I think I will improve the part that convert 2SC to human readble decimal. Because I believe it is the hardest part in this lab. And I use lots of receiver in that part. If I can, I will
improve the cleaness of that page.  

 What external resources did you use to complete this lab?
 Youtube videos. Google image, and Wiki . 

 Did you work with anyone on the labs? Describe the level of collaboration. Write the answer here. 
 No, I worked it by myself.
