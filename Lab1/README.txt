 What did you learn in this lab? 
 I learned how to use Mulimedia Logic to draw cricuit. And parctice my skills that converting truth table to 
 cricuits. 

 What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
 When I frist opened the program, I don't even know what I should do. I gradually followed instruction to finish.
 And I found that the cricuits I drew was too messy to understand, and I tried lots of ways to deal with this issue. 
 Finally I found that I can creat more receiver to make it clear.  
 
 How would you redesign this lab to make it better? 
 If I redesign this lab, I would try to finish the extra credit to earn more points.  

 What external resources did you use to complete this lab? 
 I searched on google that how to make the cricuit looks clean.  And followed some tips. 

 Did you work with anyone on the labs? Describe the level of collaboration.
 No, I finished it by myself.
