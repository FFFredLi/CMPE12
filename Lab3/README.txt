 Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable? 
      At first, I didn't know how to use if condition in MIPS, so I googled it. After that, I found that I have to use while loop in this lab, So I searched some videos from Youtube to 
understand how to do a while loop.  Finally, in printing section, I don't know how to print a character, So I searched google agian.  
 
 How would you redesign this lab to make it better? 
     I would add more comments to describe each step. 

 What external resources did you use to complete this lab? (Not including course materials) 
    Youtube videos to learn how to use "While" loop in MIPS. 
 And text from reddit that how to make an "if" condition in MIPS.
